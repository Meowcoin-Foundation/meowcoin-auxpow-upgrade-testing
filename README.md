# Meowcoin AuxPoW + Dual-PoW Upgrade: Test & Status Repo

**This repo tracks the current testing status of the Meowcoin AuxPoW + Dual-PoW chain upgrade.**  
All work and results are visible so the community can see exactly where things stand.  
Status will be updated as testing progresses through internal and public testnets.

## What Is Happening?

Meowcoin is preparing a major consensus upgrade to support **Auxiliary Proof-of-Work (AuxPoW)** alongside the existing MeowPoW algorithm.  
This will enable **merge-mining** with other Scrypt-based coins (like Litecoin, Dogecoin, Bellscoin) while retaining MeowPoW for GPU/ASIC resistance and community mining.

Key highlights of this upgrade:

- **Dual-PoW:** Meowcoin will accept both MeowPoW and Scrypt (AuxPoW) blocks, targeting a 50/50 split.
- **Merge Mining:** Pools and miners will be able to earn Meowcoin by merge-mining alongside Litecoin/Dogecoin with no loss of efficiency.
- **Fair Difficulty:** Uses LWMA difficulty adjustment to ensure neither algorithm dominates and rewards stay balanced.
- **Assets Remain Supported:** The Ravencoin-based asset system continues to work, both before and after the upgrade.
- **No Chain Split:** Existing chain data, balances, and assets are preserved and compatible with the new rules.
- **Open Testing:** This repo will transparently document every test and its status, so anyone can see whatâ€™s working and what needs more work.

## How to Use This Repo

- Check the current progress on core upgrade and integration tests.
- Follow along with internal, public testnet, and (eventually) mainnet rollout phases.
- See what areas are being tested, and what still needs attention.

## Current Status

**All items are pending initial smoke and regression testing.**  
First phase: closed/internal testnet  
Next: public testnet  
Mainnet activation follows after broad validation.
